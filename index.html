<h1>Software Developer</h1>

<p>A computer software engineer takes computer
science, engineering and mathematics, to create
computer softwares. They create programs that 
run electronic devices. An example of a software
is a calculator app on a phone. Someone has to
write all the code that makes the calculator
function, and make the calculator do one thing
when you press something, and something else
when you press something else. It is a lot to
do, and it is usually done by a team. Clients
contact the developer on what they need, whether
it’s a website or something else, and the 
developer and his/her team create it online. 
Code is the building blocks of everything 
online. Application software developers don’t
only write code though. They also design, test 
and maintain the code. Software developers
need to create an appealing online platform 
for the client. They also need to test the
platform to make sure it works, and make sure 
nothing ever breaks overtime. Your workplace
would probably be an office space with a computer 
to type the code. Or, your group can work
together and brainstorm ideas while in the
same place, or electronically.
